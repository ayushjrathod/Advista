And I'll give you some tips for your end. And I'll give you some more facts. And I'll tell you a bit about this video. I hope you know that you know In the time of the video, the most Indian video is the number one vlogging channel which is called the Sword of Joshi Vlogs They have only run their channel to 12 million just from an iPhone They have only shoot a camera on the iPhone and upload these things and some people say that iPhone is good So before that they have a real device and Android device they have also shoot it and then after 12 million they have only Sony's camera and now they have only made a number one vlog channel So if you can do that, then you can do that So now we are going to be talking about the video. I hope you like this video. If you like this video, please like this video. Before I share 3 things with you, which are very important and you will know before you are vlogging. The first thing comes in your smartphone, if you have wide angle lens, it is much better if I tell you a difference. I will tell you here, this is my smartphone and this is my iPhone. Now the video is shooting in normal mode, 1x is shooting and it is a crop day. My face will look more in the camera and the rest of the things will not come. Because it is not wide. Now if I shift it to wide angle, I can see how wide it is. I look at the area of the area. I walk, walk, run, I see people. All things will be in the vlog and the viewer will be more better If you support your smartphone wide angle lens then it will be very good Another thing is that you use your smartphone rear camera It means that the back camera is used don use it front camera use It is not good if you compare it with the rear camera. In the rear camera, quality will be good. Low light quality will be good. Stabilization will be good. 4K will support it. And there will be a lot of good things that will remain better compared to the front camera. So shoot the rear camera, it will be good. The third thing is that we talked about 4K, so you can shoot 4K. And I suggest that you shoot 4K. The first thing is that people watch TV vlogs in television. And they watch TV vlogs in TV. And TV is also supporting 4K. If you watch 4K quality in vlogs, it will be better and it will be better. So if you do 4K, do it. Another thing that I watch 4K, is that I shoot 4K. Now I shoot this video in 4K. Now I'm doing cropping, scale-out, scale-in, all these things. If I do this in HD, zoom, then the quality will be slightly reduced. If I do this in 4K, then there will not be a difference in the view. If you shoot in 4K in the vlog and you can crop it, you can't show any particular part, you can crop it, there will not be a difference in 4K. The downside is that you will increase the size. If you can do this in 4K, then I suggest this. Now we are talking about some equipment. If you want to shoot a vlog, there are some things that are very important and they are valuable for money, which I have bought myself and used to use and I will suggest you. First of all, one important thing is a tripod. It is very important. Mini tripod, especially the big tripod, it is not too much. Some people do what they do with the phone, they show back, they are also very important. But the tripod is also very important if you want to do vlogging in a different type of shot. In the short shot you will be in the camera and you will be in the landscape So you need a tripod there Sometimes you need to shoot a tripod So I will select a mini tripod Digitech tripod is reviewed I will link in the description below. This is a little bit of a tripod. This is a little bit of a $1000 round. But it has a ball head. And it's quality is good. You can see it as a joby tripod. And it has some features. You can attach the mic on it, light on it. So you can do all these things. So this is a good investment that I have done. You will find both Tripod's link in the description below. You can check out all the way. So we talked about Tripod's next thing. The other important thing that is very important is a microphone. A microphone has a good quality of people. My microphone's quality is good. I don't need to do vlogs. I will take a microphone. But I will also suggest that a microphone is good. And I will also suggest that a microphone is a good place. A external microphone is a good place. And a microphone's microphone is a good place. This will be much better quality compared to this one. Because in vlogs, what happens? The phone is far away. This is directional mic. This is right on your face. You can speak directly to your face. This will be good quality audio. If you have a good quality audio, you will better audio quality. This will be good. What else do I do? This is a microphone. This is a boy BYU M1 mic. I was bought one or two years ago. This is right now. It's a good microphone. It's only 1500 rupees. I didn't use it much, but the good microphone has reviewed it. I also compared it to this. If you want to see it, I will put the audio quality on the i-button and put it in the description. I can buy it and I will put it in the description. This is our proper vlogging setup. Before this, you don't need more things. For starting this, this is the perfect vlogging setup. If you want something else, I can suggest two things. In vlogging, we have to go to a place where it is low light. Sometimes it is light So low light solution is that you can put a portable light A small light comes and I suggest you that it comes with a RGB light And there is no much garbage I will give you a link below in the description So, you can take a portable light. Next and our last thing that I suggest you, if you really want to buy it, and buy more equipment for vlogging, so, a gimbal. This is a big gimbal and this is not a smartphone gimbal. This is a camera gimbal. I bought it on my smartphone. I don't use this much, I just kept it. I used it for a while in life. But the vloggers are very useful. Now what are you doing? A-roll where you are talking about normal vlogs. One part is B-roll. B-roll where you are showing things. For this thing you will be very useful. If you want to take a shot. If you want to take a shot in that thing, then it's okay. But you will do day to day vlogging. You will do that daily. So those things are not so much work. This gimbal will not be so much work. But if you want to do good cinematography, If you want to buy a good B roll, high quality content, then you can do a gimbal. I will suggest that DJI gimbal in the description below. This is DJI, it has a good quality, a good company, a very popular company. You will find all the links below in the description below. This was our proper smartphone vlogging setup. The light has decreased, it was behind me, the blue light will look at me. This is our proper smartphone vlogging setup. If you want to watch a vlogging setup, which is GoPro.
