It also has a 1 inch screw hole on the bottom of the mount and can be easily mounted on any selfie pole a tripod a stabilizer or a video slider so that you can shoot professional videos As you can see here I have mounted this on my tripod and it is pretty stable and it helps me to take steady shots I bought this from GearBest and it only cost me 6 euros I have also shared the link in the description box.
